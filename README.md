## Process 
1) Created an app with the typescript implemented
2) Structured the folders in order to have organized elements as:
    - Navigation
    - Common components and colors
    - Resources
    - Screens
    - Types
3) Installed required libraries for navigation
    - @react-navigation/bottom-tabs
    - @react-navigation/drawer
    - @react-navigation/native
    - @react-navigation/native-stack
    - react-native-gesture-handler
    - react-native-tab-view
    - react-native-screens
    - react-native-safe-area-context
    - react-native-reanimated
4) Structured the navigation as
    - DrawerNavigator
        - BottomTabNavigator
            - HomeStack
            - ContactScreen
5) Trying to add animations using the reanimated library into the CustomDrawerContent and the BottomTabNavigator, needed more time to add the animation correctly to the right part
6) Having fun while doing the challenge
